title: Setting up Wine for Applications on OLD Versions of Windows
---

I had a whole Post dedicated to this.


But instead I'm going to complain.

Fuck GNOME 3+, piece of shit-ass desktop environment. Inconfigurable disastrous User Experience.

Unfortunately, it comes default on fedora 32 and natively supports Wayland. Can't even set up desktop 
wallpaper rotation without installing an extension and even then, it's anybody's guess if that extension 
will work on the latest versions.
