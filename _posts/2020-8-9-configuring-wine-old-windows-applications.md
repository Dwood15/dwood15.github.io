title: Setting up Wine for Applications on OLD Versions of Windows
---

I had a whole Post dedicated to this.

But instead I'm going to complain.

Fuck GNOME 3+, piece of shit-ass desktop environment. Inconfigurable, disastrous User Experience.

Unfortunately, it comes default on fedora 32 

 - ... and natively supports Wayland (Good! I want to support that!)
 - ... but Cinnamon doesn't (Bad!) 
 - ... and I just spend the last 3 days configuring GNOME to reduce the cancer.

- Wallpaper rotation without installing an extension doesn't work, and even then, it's anybody's guess 
if that extension will work on the latest version of GNOME.

- Windows key opens the Applications view. YES, the MOST USABLE thing for me when I press the SUPER key
is for a huge overlay to pop up, my windows to be reshuffled, and for a quick menu to pop up there. Who 
could possibly want a dock or start-menu-style window to pop up? CERTAINLY ONLY PLEBEIANS.

- Nautilus is ALSO complete and utter disaster. Who wants double clicking on an archive to be to open the
archive manager? Clearly, NO ONE.

- Who wants their application title bars to be slim and sleek? Certainly not the GNOME v3+ designers.

- Surely, when I open the applications menu, and search for an installed application, right click it, 
and attempt to view its application details, what I wanted was not a file-manager style manager. No,
what EVERYONE really wants, is to open the software application, where there's no way to go to the local
install directory or local configuration files. 

- Did your old habits of double clicking on a compressed file cause a huge file to decompress in the background?
The GNOME tracker indexing utility's got you covered! We'll gobble up all of your threads and all your 32 GB of 
ram. No worries, this will only enter into a service-endless restart loop as fedora kills the offending service 
and the service attempts to restart on every reboot. May Linus Himself help you if you're on Ubuntu - your system 
will only freeze and you'll be forced to reboot, start up htop, search for the application, and try to stop it 
before it takes full control of your system resources. If you're like me and you're on Fedora 32, they actually 
integrated some new features which will kill the heaviest-resource-users, so your system stays responsive.

Seriously. Whoever works on the GNOME project and is leading the charge on these fundamentally disastrous UX
decisions that reduce customizability and configurability and throw away literal decades of User Experience
learning and knowledge? 

You should be ashamed of what you've done. You know nothing of design and usability or communication to Users,
ESPECIALLY ones who've been using applications like this for DECADES, across multiple operating systems. Some 
of these behaviors translate between Mac and Windows for fuck's sake, and you choose to remove the gains from 
learning and knowing how those systems work down the drain?

What the fuck is wrong with you? Whoever you are, group or set of people, you should be ashamed of what 
you have done.

Q: If you hate it so much, why, then, are you still on GNOME? 


A: Because I am an idiot and spent all weekend getting fedora set up and didn't realize it was GNOME until 
it was too late. Enough to anger me to make this rant. I don't like setting up new DE's, so I'm giving it 
a college try
