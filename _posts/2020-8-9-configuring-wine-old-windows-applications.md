Fuck GNOME 3+, piece of shit-ass desktop environment. Inconfigurable, disastrous User Experience.

Unfortunately, it comes default on fedora 32 

 - ... and natively supports Wayland (Good! I want to support that!)
 - ... but Cinnamon doesn't (Bad!) 
 - ... and I just spend the last 3 days configuring GNOME to reduce the cancer.

- Wallpaper rotation without installing an extension doesn't work, and even then, it's anybody's guess 
if that extension will work on the latest version of GNOME.
